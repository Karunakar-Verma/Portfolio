        Hi, I'm Karunakar Verma — a MERN Stack Developer with a strong focus on building responsive, scalable, and intuitive web applications.
I enjoy converting complex requirements into simple, efficient solutions. With hands-on experience in React, Node.js, REST APIs, MongoDB, and modern frontend frameworks, I love crafting digital experiences that are visually appealing and technically robust.

I’m passionate about problem-solving, writing clean code, and continuously improving my skills. When I’m not coding, I explore new technologies, refine my projects, or learn better ways to design seamless user experiences.
